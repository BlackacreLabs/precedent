# Paragraph Numbering

There are a number of ways to count paragraphs. Fortunately, Supreme
Court opinions are formatted rather consistently, with relatively few
kinds of block type elements and styles.

The major decisions left are as follows:

1. Whether to count continuing (flush) paragraphs after block quotations as new paragraphs
2. Whether to count paragraphs within block quotations at all,
   separately per block quotation, or together with the other paragraphs
   of the document.

Precedent decides as follows:

1. Flush continuing paragraphs are new paragraphs for numbering purposes.
2. Blockquote paragraphs are numbered in sequence with body paragraphs.

An example:

~~~
  ¶1 This is a standard indented paragraph. It runs to a couple of lines,
and refers to a blockquote that immediately follows:

    ¶2 This is a flush blockquote paragraph of one line.

      ¶3 The blockquote continues with an indented paragraph running across
    two lines.

¶4 This is a continuation from the above paragraph, but counts as another
paragraph for numbering purposes.
